# Data-Query-with-RAG-OpenAI-Embeddings-and-Vector-Database

This repository contains a project that demonstrates how to use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAI's GPT-4 model and Pinecone vector database to query a dataset stored in a CSV file. The project involves creating vector embeddings from the data in the CSV file and then querying the vector embeddings data using natural language queries.
